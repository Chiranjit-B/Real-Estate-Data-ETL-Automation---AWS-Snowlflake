# 📊 Real Estate Data Pipeline Project with AWS, Snowflake, and Power BI 📈

Welcome to the Real Estate Data Pipeline Project! This repository outlines a streamlined data pipeline for automating the ingestion, transformation, and visualization of real estate data. The primary data source is Redfin, with AWS as the cloud infrastructure, Snowflake for data warehousing, and Power BI for visualization. This setup provides near-real-time insights into real estate trends.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project addresses the need for scalable, real-time analytics on real estate data. Using Redfin as the data source, we extract information, transform it for consistency and usability, and load it into Snowflake, where it becomes accessible for advanced analysis and reporting. The architecture is designed for efficiency and leverages several cloud services for a reliable data pipeline.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Automated Data Pipeline**: Ensures real-time or near-real-time data loading and transformation.
- **Cloud-Native Infrastructure**: Built on AWS, allowing for seamless data handling and scalability.
- **Scalable Data Warehouse**: Snowflake is used to store and manage transformed data, supporting large-scale analytics.
- **Powerful Visualization**: Power BI provides a rich visual interface for real estate analytics, making insights easily accessible.

## 🏗️ Workflow

### 1. **Data Extraction from Redfin** 🏠
   - The pipeline begins by extracting data from Redfin, covering various metrics like property prices, inventory, and sales trends.
   - The data is fetched using a custom Python script, which pulls fresh information and prepares it for initial staging in AWS.

### 2. **Loading Raw Data to AWS S3** ☁️
   - The extracted data is stored in a "Raw Data" S3 bucket on AWS.
   - This bucket serves as a holding area, ensuring data is available for further transformation while maintaining the original format for reference.

### 3. **Data Transformation and Processing** 🔄
   - Using a Jupyter notebook, data is processed to handle inconsistencies, null values, and format discrepancies.
   - This transformation ensures that the data is standardized and ready for analytics.
   - The transformed data is then moved to a "Transformed Data" S3 bucket, indicating it’s ready for loading into Snowflake.

### 4. **Automated Data Loading to Snowflake via Snowpipe** ❄️
   - **Snowpipe Trigger**: A Snowpipe trigger monitors the Transformed Data S3 bucket. Whenever new files arrive, the trigger activates Snowpipe to initiate data ingestion automatically.
   - **Snowpipe**: Snowpipe takes the newly available data and ingests it directly into Snowflake, loading it into the designated table.
   - This setup ensures a continuous and automated data flow from S3 to Snowflake, supporting near-real-time updates for analytics.

### 5. **Data Storage in Snowflake** 🗄️
   - The ingested data is stored in a Snowflake table under a dedicated schema, designed specifically for real estate data analytics.
   - With Snowflake's scalability, this table can handle increasing data volumes without compromising performance.

### 6. **Data Visualization with Power BI** 📊
   - Power BI connects to Snowflake, allowing for dynamic, visual exploration of real estate data.
   - Users can interact with dashboards to explore trends, filter data, and generate insights based on different metrics like median sale price, inventory levels, and more.
   - This visualization layer transforms raw numbers into meaningful insights, providing business intelligence at a glance.

## 💡 Key Technologies & Components

- **AWS S3**: Storage buckets for raw and transformed data, ensuring data is reliably accessible and secure.
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrates ETL workflows, automating each step of the pipeline to maintain data flow.
- **Snowflake**: A high-performance data warehouse used to store processed data, ready for querying and analytics.
- **Snowpipe**: Automated data ingestion tool that loads new data from S3 into Snowflake as soon as it arrives, ensuring up-to-date information for analysis.
- **Power BI**: Visualization tool to present insights derived from the Snowflake-stored data in an interactive, user-friendly manner.

## 📈 Business Value

This pipeline enables stakeholders to:

1. **Monitor Market Trends**: With updated real estate data, businesses can keep track of key trends, making timely decisions.
2. **Identify Opportunities**: Analyzing metrics like median sale price and inventory can reveal investment opportunities.
3. **Optimize Inventory**: Real estate agents can use insights on months of supply and homes sold to adjust their strategies.
4. **Regional Analysis**: By diving into data segmented by city or state, agents can focus efforts on areas with high demand or lower inventory.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Automated**: Airflow ensures that every part of the ETL process is automated, from extraction to transformation and loading.
2. **Scalable**: The use of cloud-native technologies (AWS, Snowflake) provides the flexibility to handle large volumes of data and accommodate future growth.
3. **Insight-Driven**: Power BI translates numbers into actionable insights, bridging the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making.

## 🎬 Getting Started

To deploy this pipeline on your setup:
1. Configure your environment following the setup instructions.
2. Set up Airflow on an EC2 instance to manage workflows.
3. Create the necessary S3 buckets, Snowflake tables, and schemas.
4. Execute the Python scripts and notebooks to initiate the ETL pipeline.
5. Access Power BI to explore the visualized data and gain insights.

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., Snowflake and AWS credentials).
- **Data Governance**: Ensure that data in S3 and Snowflake complies with organizational data governance policies.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Schedule regular checks on pipeline components, especially Snowpipe and its trigger, to ensure continuous data flow.
